# servlet-framework

An Lightweight MVC Framework

- Use Facelets as view technology
- Fast (my last test was 15-18k requests per seconds, and with Spring i got 2-5k requests per second, i'll update this soon with current build, since it several features was added since)
- MVC
- Running in production environment since 2015, with high amounts of requests.
- Support RESTful
- Simple to use, controllers is similar to Spring

I created this framework alone in 2015, with speed and lightweight in mind, i decided to share it now, so who is interested can learn from it, or use it (i used this in many production projects already)
I'll keep updating this adding new features and fixing bugs, all suggestions are welcome.

I'll add few examples soon.
I'll try to make an docummentation soon.
